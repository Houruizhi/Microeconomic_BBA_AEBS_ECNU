We have two mini-courses jointly designed by the guest lecturer and our instructor. Each of them is a co-author with Dr. Luyao Zhang in academia and industry. Each guest lecturer contributes their area of expertise and Dr. Luyao Zhang worked with them to produce the project-based and research-directed mini-courses. We have pre- and after-course questionnaires for each mini-course respectively. I worked on implementing the questionnaire, collecting data, and analyze the result. I acknowledge Dr. Luyao Zhang in guiding me in all the endeavors. 

## **Guest Lecture 1: Crypto-economics**
