We have two mini-courses jointly designed by the guest lecturer and our instructor. Each of them is a co-author with Dr. Luyao Zhang in academia and industry. Each guest lecturer contributes their area of expertise and Dr. Luyao Zhang worked with them to produce the project-based and research-directed mini-courses. We have pre- and after-course questionaire for each mini-course respectively. I worked on implementing the questionaires, collecting data, and analyze the result. I acknowledge Dr. Luyao Zhang in guiding me in all the endeavors. 

## **Guest Lecture 1: Crypto-economics**

### **Course Description**：
In this course, we will study the basics of Crypto Economics. Topics including Cryptocurrency, Blockchain, Smart Contract, and Decentralized Finance will be elaborated via case studies. The students will enjoy an experiential education to understand the original drive, applications, and pros & cons of each crypto-economic project/product/technology. Moreover, the student will identify the limitations of the existing decentralized finance project and develop strategies to improve upon it in our research-directed and project-based cloud classroom.

### **Guest Lecturer**: 

[Dr. Yulin Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yulineth/) leads research on crypto-economics and on-chain governance systems as Senior Economist at DFINITY Foundation, aligned with his research interest in macroeconomics, monetary economics, financial stability, blockchain, and crypto-economics.
