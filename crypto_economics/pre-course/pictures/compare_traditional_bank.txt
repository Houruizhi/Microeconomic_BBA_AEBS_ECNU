Traditional Banks exist in real life, and the process is more troublesome than Banks on blockchains. And the money you receive is real, unlike the money that the Banks in the block chain are virtual.
The deal can¡¯t be recover in those with blockchain but the deal is more free
traditional bank, the bank is the third party. However, the one on the blockchain plays as a platform for buyers and sellers to do the transaction directly.
Quicker transactions, for instance. Conventional ways of banking are known to consume a lot of time as third parties are always needed. However, blockchain can do in a matter of seconds the things that would normally take three days to complete. It has also reduced transaction costs.
I think the banks on the blockchain is safer, more efficient, and easy to access
The traditional one has mostly complete service mechanism but is not professional. The other is more professional but it official capacity is limited.
When you put money in traditional bank, you lose sight of it. It goes to a black box and you have no idea whether it exists there or not. You just hope you can withdraw it when you need it. Banks on the blockchain are completely different. You can see exactly where your money is at any time. You never lose sight of it and you never lose control of it.
the traditional one is centralization and the other is decentralization
The banking system is characterized by central banks which have some degree of control over commercial banks, and as such, they operate in a centralized system. A private blockchain does not have a central authority and therefore the system is decentralized.
